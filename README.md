The game Bulls and Cows is a guessing and logical game typically played between two players. The goal of the game is for one player to guess a hidden number (or word) chosen by the other player. While the game is traditionally played with numbers, there are different versions that can be played with words as well.

Rules and How to Play (Numeric Version):
Choosing a Hidden Number: One player (or the system) selects a hidden multi-digit number. This number should contain unique digits, meaning no repeated digits. Usually, the number is 4 digits long, but it can be 3 or 5 digits as well.

Guessing: The other player tries to guess the hidden number. Each guess must be the same length as the hidden number and must also have unique digits.

Bulls and Cows:

Bull: A "Bull" is when a digit is guessed correctly in both value and position.
Cow: A "Cow" is when a digit exists in the hidden number but is in the wrong position.
Responding to Guesses: After each guess, the player is informed how many Bulls and how many Cows they have.

Example: Let's say the hidden number is 1234, and the player's guess is 1243.
The digit 1 is correct in both value and position: 1 Bull.
The digits 2 and 3 exist in the hidden number but are in the wrong position: 2 Cows.
The digit 4 is in the wrong position but exists: 1 Cow.
In this case, the player would be told they have 1 Bull and 2 Cows.
Continuing the Game: The player continues guessing until all digits are guessed correctly and all digits are Bulls.

Objective:
The objective is for the player to guess the hidden number by using logical deductions. The game continues until the player correctly guesses all the digits in the correct positions.
